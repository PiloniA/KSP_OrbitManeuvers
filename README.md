# KSP_OrbitManeuvers

This project is a startup project for several Mods and helper programs for Kerbal Space Program and Kerbal Space Program 2
Currently it can only be used to create a Kerbol System with all physical and orbital parameters (values are not correct yet).
In the future it is planned to calculate orbital mechanics, transfer orbits and transfer windows.
